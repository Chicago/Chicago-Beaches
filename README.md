# Chicago-Beaches
Renel Chesak built a Shiny app for understanding the E. coli levels at Chicago beaches:

The algorithm used in this app was built by the City of Chicago's Department of Innovation and Technology (@cityofchicago), and it's incorporation into this app would not have been possible without the help of my friend and former city intern, Callin Osborn (@CallinOsborn).
