To do

Renel:
1.	I need predictions for each individual beach as output to tie it to the map 
2.	Record what peopleâ€™s responses are for the algorithm
3.	Change slider from threshold to FP (false alarms) rate (setting FP rate equal for both models) IN PERCENTAGE = false alarms / (Correct rejections + false alarms)
4.	Change color of beaches on prediction map to a color scale explaining how well their model performed on that beach
5.	Change prediction bar graph to be percentage and only include hits and false alarms
  a.	Correct rejections + false alarms = good days. 
  b.	Hits
6.	Want to display the $ cost of a hit (cost of keeping people safe)
  a.	I need $ value for cost of a false alarm
  b.	Incorporate the cost of a test
7. Re-group beaches based on correlations
8. Fix issue with fonts not showing up on graphs. Callin, do you know an easy way to do this?


Callin:
1.	Give Renel predictions for each individual beach as output to tie it to the map 
2.	Make sure the verbage in each tab is accurate.
3.	Fix error when selecting every beach for the algorithm.
4.	Fix issue when you select no beaches
5. Get Renel $ value for cost of a false alarm
6. Get Renel $ value for cost of a test
