To do

Renel:
1.	Record what people’s responses are for the algorithm
2.	DONE Replace accuracy with a simple measure for the prediction outcomes
3.	DONE Add threshold slider that updates instantly (how instantly?)
  a.	not tied to update button? ********Callin, what were we thinking on this one? *************
4.	Tie prediction outcomes to map (BIG)
  a.	I need predictions for each individual beach as output to tie it to the map 
5.	DONE Upload all my files
6.	Look more professional
7.	DONE Get a license fdile (see tldrlegal.com)
  a.	Mit
  b.	Apache
  c.	Lgpl
8.	Find out more about user group presentation

Callin:
1.	Send Renel a .csv file of the “model summary” output (too hard for me to create it myself)
2.	I need predictions for each individual beach as output to tie it to the map 
3.	I need to know how to color the clusters on the map – how is this algorithm using the beach input?
4.	The North Avenue and Oak Street beaches to be fixed in the algorithm code so they can be added back to the beach checklist
5.	Make the algorithm run much faster (maybe 5 seconds tops)
6.	We need to tie the slider input to the algorithm? Right now, I think it is permanently set at 235. The only thing the slider currently changes is which tp, fn, tn, fp are selected from the model summary. Is this what they want?
